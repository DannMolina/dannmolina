Why so serious? Have some fun ✨

Hey there! I'm just your laid-back tech explorer with around 5 years of hacking away at the keyboard in the enterprise realm. By day, I'm a code ninja, unraveling the mysteries of the tech industry. But when the sun sets, you'll find me mastering the art of catching Z's – because, let's be real, sleep is my favorite tech of all. 😴💻
